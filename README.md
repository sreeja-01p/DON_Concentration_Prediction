Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sreeja-01p/DON_Concentration_Prediction.git
cd DON_Concentration_Prediction
```

Install dependencies which include PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and flask

Run the Training Notebook:

Open DON_concentration_prediction.ipynb in Colab and follow the instructions to preprocess data, train the model and evaluate performance.
The notebook saves the trained model (model.pth) and the scaler (scaler.pkl).

Run the Flask App:
```python app.py```

The current best model predicts DON concentration with MAE 3815.786, RMSE: 10459.727 and RÂ² score: 0.609
